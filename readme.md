Boxel is a wooden box that contains a Raspberry Pi and a 32x32 LED matrix.

A local HTTP server allows any device on the same network to act as a remote controller to choose and configure among several modes: digital clock, weather stats and forecast, digital photo frame, and so on.

## Material

<img src="media/material.jpg" width="100%" alt="needed material">

* Raspberry Pi with a 40 pin GPIO header (tested with a `Pi 2 Model B Rev 1.1`)
* 32x32 LED matrix and its DC cable
* 14 female to female jumper wires
* DC to female 2.1mm Jack adapter
* 5V male Jack to male USB adapter (1A)
* Micro USB to USB adapter (2.4A)
* USB to AC adapter (5V 3.4A with 2 ports)
* USB Wi-Fi dongle
* A few wooden planks, screws, small shelf brackets

## Software installation

### On the dev machine

Clone the project and install the dependencies:

```
git clone git@github.com:johansatge/boxel.git
cd boxel/app
npm install
```

Start the app in dry run (so it doesn't try to initialize the LED matrix):

```
node app/index.js --dry-run
```

### On the Raspberry Pi

#### Base install

* Use [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/) to install the latest Raspbian on the SD card (tested version: `10 Buster`)
* From the GUI (`startx`), configure:
  * The user (`pi`), current date & time, location
  * The wifi
  * Enable SSH & [configure a key](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/passwordless.md) if needed
* Disable on-board sound in `/boot/config.txt` by setting `dtparam=audio=off`

#### Node.js

Install Node.js LTS (tested version: `node 12.16.2` / `npm 6.14.4`)

```
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo bash -
sudo apt-get install nodejs
```

#### Project installation

From the dev machine, sync the app:

```bash
sh sync.sh
```

On the Pi, install the dependencies:

```bash
cd /home/pi/boxel-app
npm install
```

Create a state file and make sure it's writable:

```bash
touch /home/pi/boxel-app/.state.json
chmod 777 /home/pi/boxel-app/.state.json
# Todo: check what user is node using to give proper r/w permissions
```

Create a file to expose Netatmo credentials:

```bash
touch /home/pi/boxel-app/.netatmo.json
# The file looks like this:
# {
#   "clientId": "aaaa",
#   "clientSecret": "bbbb",
#   "username": "cccc",
#   "password": "dddd"
# }
```

Finally, start the app:

```bash
sudo node /home/pi/boxel-app/index.js
```
